GY-85-arduino
=============

A basic GY-85 raw data getter for arduino. Using IIC bus. 
Tested with arduino 1.6.5 IDE.

Wireing for arduino UNO:

GY-85   ->   Arduino
--------------------
VCC_IN  ->   5V
GND     ->   GND
SCL     ->   A5
SDA     ->   A4

For other arduino boards you have to check the IIC pins!

Installation:

After downloading you have to remove dashes from the folder name, then move the folder to your:
For Windows- Program Files/Arduino/Libraries.
For MacOSX-  Documents/Arduino/Libraries.
Now restart the Arduino application. GY85 should appear in your File->Eaxmples.
